        <!--An About Me section that contains the following information:

A description that shows your passion for web development and your willingness to work with others

One or two sentences that describe other interests you have outside of web development-->
        <p class = "wrapper">
          The idea of software development has always fascinated me. After working as a project manager in construction for the NYC area, I wanted to submerge in something I was truly passionate in, software development. I have always had bright ideas for apps and web services and would love to show the world some of the amazing things I will create one day!</p>
        
        <p class = "wrapper">
         outside of software development I love music and art, I'm an avid writer, not just in code but also in screenplays! My hands are always near a keyboard.
